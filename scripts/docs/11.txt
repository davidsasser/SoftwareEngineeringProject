16.  Abstract 

The primary goal of this research was to develop a tool for the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to 
improve methods to identify and prioritize locations with increased or elevated risk for pedestrian and bicycle crashes. 
This report includes a comprehensive review of many scientific reports and papers about the pedestrian and bicycle 
crashes on road segments or intersections. To develop the risk model data were collected from 188 segments and 184 
intersections randomly selected following the data collection plan. . These samples included 213 bicycle and pedestrian 
crashes on the segments and 238 at intersections. Geometric, land use, volume, and crash data were collected from 
different databases, including Google Maps, EPA’s Smart Location Database and the ODOT crash database from 2009-
2013. The research team developed logistic regression models for both crash occurrence (crash or not) and crash 
severity models. The models related to crash severity were not robust, most likely due to the few segments and 
intersections with severe crashes in the dataset. The crash occurrence models were used to create a risk-scoring tool. 
The risk-scoring tool was applied to safety projects identified in the 2015 All Roads Transportation Safety (ARTS) 
project lists from Oregon DOT’s Region 1 and 2. The risk scores for the case study applications aligned reasonably well 
with the project’s benefit-costs estimates.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 

In 2013, there were 52 pedestrian and three bicyclist fatalities – approximately 17% of the total 
traffic fatalities in Oregon (Bergh and Griffin, 2013). There were an additional 814 pedestrians 
and 922 bicyclists injured in that same year. These fatalities and injuries are a concern for many 
communities in Oregon. To help mitigate the high social cost of these events, the Oregon 
Department of Transportation (ODOT) has identified pedestrian and bicycle crashes as a primary 
focus area for investing infrastructure funding. ODOT has appropriated approximately $4 million 
annually in the All Roads Transportation Safety Program (ARTS) to help address this key need. 
Selecting projects based only on crash performance is challenging because pedestrian and 
bicycle crashes are few. Predicting where these crashes will occur next is also a challenging task. 
An alternative to frequency-based selection is to develop a risk-based criteria and method.  

In a transportation context, risk is defined as a probability or threat of damage, injury, liability, 
loss, or any other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities, and 
that may be avoided through preemptive action.  The amount of risk can be interpreted by the 
probability of the outcome and potential severity of the outcome if the event occurs. This can be 
presented as the risk matrix in Figure 1.1 (Berdica, 2002).  For transportation and vulnerable 
road users, the probability is a function of exposure and consequence is a function of operating 
conditions (e.g., vehicle speeds and size). Risk scoring should include elements of exposure and 
expectations of the severity of the outcome.   

Figure 1.1: Risk Matrix, Darker Shading Indicates Higher Risk (Berdica, 2002) 

 

Prior to this research project, Kittelson & Associates, Inc. produced a systemic safety analysis of  
pedestrian and bicycle safety for ODOT (Bergh et al., 2013).  This thorough and detailed report 
analyzed pedestrian and bicycle crashes following a systemic safety planning approach. The 
objective of the plan was to “identify corridors with the most potential for reducing frequency 
and severity of pedestrian and bicycle crashes.” The report attempted to match effective safety 

1 

 
countermeasures with potential locations for improvements by identifying key patterns of 
behavior and roadway conditions that create high-risk locations. The results of the plan were 
presented and discussed with stakeholders from around Oregon.  Prioritized lists of corridors, 
both on state highways and non-state roads, were developed. A frequency-based and risk-based 
prioritization was developed. The quantification of risk factors and the magnitude of their 
influence was constrained by limited supplemental data that the project was able to collect. Thus, 
many of the risk scores were based on best judgment.  

The objective of this research was to develop a risk-scoring method with weights derived from a 
data analysis. To accomplish this, the research assembled a robust dataset merging data elements 
collected on segments, at intersections. Selection of segments for data collection was random and 
no attempt was made to identify high-crash locations. Logistic models were developed and the 
results transformed to a simple tool. Application of the tool to actual ARTS projects was done to 
demonstrate the applicability.  

This final report summarizes the research and is organized in six chapters. Chapter 2.0  presents 
a brief literature review. Chapter 3.0 describes the process used to identify the data collection 
methods used to assemble the data. Chapter 4.0 reviews the basic descriptive analysis of the data 
and the preparation of the modeling dataset. Chapter 5.0 then presents the modeling 
methodology, and Chapter 6.0 summarizes the findings. In Chapter 7.0, the conversion of the 
modeling results to a risk-scoring tool is presented, and sample applications are presented in 
Chapter 8.0. Finally, Chapter 9.0 summarizes the work and discusses the limitations and 
recommendations for future work.

2.0  LITERATURE REVIEW 

This literature review is organized into three sections. First, brief examples of risk-based 
approaches to network screening for highway safety are presented with examples of methods to 
prioritize or score non-motorized projects. The following sections provide a detailed review of 
the factors affecting bicycle and pedestrian safety. 

2.1  RISK-BASED METHODS FOR PRIORITIZING SAFETY  
Most network screening techniques that are used to identify high-crash locations are crash-based 
(AASHTO, 2010). The risk-based approaches that are the focus of this literature review (using 
the potential for crash outcomes combined with severity) are relatively rare in the crash 
screening methods (especially for motor vehicles). This is primarily due to fact that there are few 
reported  bicycle or pedestrian crashes and there is insufficient exposure data to identify trouble 
spots. In this section, the systemic safety approach is presented, followed by a brief review of 
risk-based scoring methods for highways. Finally, since the perceptions of safety and actual 
safety can be distinctly different, safety prioritization measures for non-motorized safety that 
help include this factor are presented. 

2.1.1  Systemic Safety Approach 
Recently, in recognition that many approaches to safety improvement were generally only 
reactive (i.e., identifying the locations with high crash frequency), the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) has been promoting an approach to highways safety screening and 
countermeasure application that is termed “systemic safety.” The systemic safety approach, 
illustrated in Figure 2.1 taken from Systemic Safety Project Selection Tool, can be described as a 
methodology to identify, diagnose and treat locations that are at high risk for crashes on a 
system-wide basis through a data-driven approach (Preston et al., 2013). The figure shows the 
three key elements for the overall program.

Figure 2.1: Systemic Safety Approach 

 

Within Element 1, the steps most relevant to this review are the steps to identify crash types and 
risk factors. After first finding the facility and crash type to focus on (usually using a crash-tree 
diagram that shows the percentage of crashes, both total and severe, in various categories of 
roads/intersections), a more detailed analysis can reveal some measurable characteristics of the 
facility that may be subject to treatment. For example, after first identifying rural, undivided, 
two-lane roadways as a focus area, the NYSDOT further compared crashes on curves by radii. 
As shown in Figure 2.2, they compared curve radii in four categories. When compared with all 
curves along the focus facility type, overrepresented features become clear. While only 
representing 7% of the curves reviewed, curves with a curve radius less than 300 feet accounted 
for 12% of severe crashes. Thus, curve radii less than 300 feet were identified as a risk factor. 
Through further analysis, the factors were assigned scores that could be combined in an overall 
risk analysis.  

It should be noted that the prior work by Kittelson & Associates, Inc. mentioned in the 
introduction section a similar approach to identify some of the risk factors for the pedestrian and 
bicycle crashes in Oregon.

2.1.2  U.S. Road Assessment Program 
The U.S. Road Assessment Program (USRAP) aims to provide a “systematic road assessment 
program in North America to inform motorists of the level of safety on the roads they travel.” 
(Harwood et al., 2008). The program builds on the success of the European Road Assessment 
Program (RAP), where the methods were developed.  The RAP program categorizes roadways in 
a number of traditional ways (frequency and rate of fatal crashes, the difference from average 
rate performance), but also includes a method to develop a road protection score. The road 
protection score is calculated based on the potential for severe outcomes for head-on, run-off-
the-road, and intersection crashes. The scoring is based on critical sub-factors, such as the width 
of the median for head-on crashes. For each of the crash types, there is a relative risk score 
calculated from a set of sub-factors that is clearly associated with the risk.  The methodology 
prescribes that relative risk scores (converted to a simple index) are weighted together, with 15% 
for head-on crashes, 19% for run-off-the-road crashes and 66% for intersection crashes for the 
road segment under consideration.  

A sample of the weighting table for head-on crashes is shown in Figure 2.1. The figure shows 
that the posted speed and degree of separation of opposing vehicle lanes influence the relative 
risk assigned to a specific roadway segment. For example, for an undivided roadway with a 
posted speed of 70 mph, the relative risk score is 38. This is translated to a 1 on the star rating on 
a 1-4 scale, with 4 being the lowest risk. For the same road but with a posted speed of 35 mph, 
the score is 1- which translates to a star score of 1 (the lowest risk segments). A similar process 
is done for the other crash types; then an aggregated star score is computed. A sample of the 
process, shown in map form for state highways in southeastern Iowa, is shown in Figure 2.4. On 
the map, the higher risk 1-2 starred segments can be seen as the red and black segments. The 
method is an example of translating relative risk factors to an index to create a ranking of 
segments.

2.1.3  Pedestrian and Bicyclist Intersection Safety Indices 
In 2006, the FHWA sponsored research to develop the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Indices 
(Ped ISI and Bike ISI). The purpose of the ISI was to allow engineers and planners to proactively 
identify intersection crossings and approach legs which should be the greatest priority for 
undergoing pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements (Carter et al., 2006). In the 
methodology, the Ped and Bike ISI score is an evaluation of each approach leg of an intersection 
rather than evaluating the intersection as a whole. For example, a four-leg intersection would 
have four possible pedestrian safety scores, one for each crossing, and 12 possible bicycle safety 
scores, three for each leg (through, right lane, left lane). The approach with higher scores 
indicates a greater priority for an in-depth safety assessment. This tool applies to intersections 
with the following characteristics:  

•  Three- or four-leg intersections 

•  Signalized, two-way stop, and four-way stop 

•  Traffic volume from 600 to 5,000 vehicle per day 

•  One-way or two-way roads 

•  One to four through lanes 

•  Speed limit from 15 to 45 mph 

 

To develop these indices, the researchers collected video and data from 68 pedestrian crossing 
intersections and 67 bicycle approaches at intersections in Florida, Pennsylvania, California, and 
Oregon. Safety ratings (opinion) from experts and bicycle/pedestrian-motorist interactions from 
a video analysis of each site were used to generate a multivariate linear regression model to 
explain the safety indices. The resulting models are listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2. The 
variables included in the model could be considered similar to risk factors. In the Bicycle ISI 
there are separate models depending on the type of maneuver the cyclist would be making (a 
through movement, a left turn or a right turn). The sign on the model coefficients and the units 
can be used to interpret the effect on the ISI score (where a larger ISI indicates a higher priority 
for improvement). For example, in the Ped ISI model the sign on the coefficient on a number of 
through lanes is positive, indicating that as the number of lanes increases, the relative safety of 
pedestrian crossing decreases.
