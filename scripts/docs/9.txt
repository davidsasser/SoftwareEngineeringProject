ABSTRACT 

Objective: Vehicle crashes which involved pedestrian at intersections have been reported occasionally. 

The injury severity of pedestrians in these crashes seems significantly related to driver and pedestrian 

attributes, vehicle characteristics, and the geometry of intersections. Identifying factors associated with 

pedestrian injury severity (PIS) is critical for reducing crashes and improving safety. For developing the 

proposed probit models, drivers who involved crashes are classified into three groups: young drivers (16
