The objective of this study was to develop crash modification factors for 
four treatment types: rectangular rapid-flashing beacon (RRFB), pedes-
trian hybrid beacon (PHB), pedestrian refuge island (RI), and advance 
yield or stop markings and signs (AS). From 14 cities throughout the 
United States, 975 treatment and comparison sites were selected. Most 
of the treatment sites were selected at intersections on urban, multi-
lane streets, because these locations present a high risk for pedestrian 
crashes and are where countermeasures typically are needed most. For 
each treatment site, relevant data were collected on the treatment char-
acteristics, traffic, geometric, and roadway variables, and the pedestrian 
crashes and other crash types that occurred at each site. Cross-sectional 
regression models and before–after empirical Bayesian analysis tech-
niques were used to determine the crash effects of each treatment type. 
All four of the treatment types were found to be associated with reduc-
tions in pedestrian crash risk, compared with the reductions at untreated 
sites. PHBs were associated with the greatest reduction of pedestrian 
crash risk (55% reduction), followed by RRFBs (47% reduction), RIs 
(32% reduction), and AS (25% reduction). The results for RRFBs had 
their basis in a limited sample and must be used with caution.

The safety of pedestrians who attempt to cross streets, particularly 
on high-speed, high-volume multilane roads, continues to be a prob-
lem in the United States. Furthermore, the safety effects of some of 
the more promising treatments to reduce pedestrian crashes need to 
be better understood. Numerous studies have been conducted in the 
United States and abroad in recent years on the effects of various 
geometric and traffic control treatments at unsignalized crossings. 
However, most of those evaluations have relied on behavioral and 
operational measures of effectiveness (e.g., pedestrian–vehicle con-
flicts, vehicle speeds, and driver yielding behavior) rather than on

crashes as the measure of effectiveness (1). The lack of crash-based 
evaluations for such pedestrian treatments largely results from sam-
ple size issues. That is, pedestrian crashes usually do not cluster  
to the same degree at specific sites, so a larger number of treatment 
and comparison sites are needed to obtain sufficient statistical power 
to detect a change in crashes as a result of the treatment, compared 
with the evaluation of countermeasures for vehicle–vehicle crashes 
that occur at a higher frequency.

Thus evaluations conducted over a wider region and over a longer 
time period are needed to obtain an adequate sample size to develop 
crash modification factors (CMFs) or crash modification functions 
(CMFunctions) that can provide guidance as to the most effective 
pedestrian crossing treatments to use. NCHRP Project 17-56 sought 
to develop CMFs for selected pedestrian crossing treatments for 
various traffic and roadway conditions to the extent possible (2). 
Initially, eight treatments were considered, but it was not possible 
to find a sufficient sample of sites for all of these treatments. Also, 
consideration was given to the selection of treatments for evalua-
tion that were believed to be of the most interest to local and state 
traffic and safety officials. On the basis of these considerations, the 
following four treatments were selected for crash-based evaluation 
in this study:

•	 Rectangular rapid-flashing beacon (RRFB),
•	 Pedestrian hybrid beacon (PHB),
•	 Pedestrian refuge island (RI), and
•	 Advance yield or stop markings and signs (AS).

The next section describes the known research literature on these 
treatments and is followed by details on data, analysis, results, rec-
ommendations, and limitations. Further details about the study are 
available in Zegeer et al. (2).

Literature review

AS treatments are a type of pavement marking placed before a cross-
walk to increase the distance at which drivers stop or yield to allow 
pedestrians to cross. An increase in the distance between yielding 
vehicles and pedestrians increases the ability of motorists in other 
lanes to see pedestrians as they cross and to yield accordingly. Pedes-
trian visibility of oncoming traffic is improved. Ten previous studies 
indicated that AS treatment reduced pedestrian–vehicle conflicts and 
increased motorist yielding (1).

Pedestrian RIs, sometimes referred to as center islands or pedes-
trian islands, are raised areas that help protect pedestrians who are 
crossing the road at intersections and midblock locations. The pres-
ence of a median RI in the middle of a street or intersection allows 
pedestrians to focus on one direction of traffic at a time as they cross 
and gives them a place to wait for an adequate gap between vehi-
cles. Islands are appropriate for use at uncontrolled and signalized 
crosswalk locations. In cases in which the road is wide enough and 
on-street parking exists, center islands can be combined with curb 
extensions to further enhance pedestrian safety (3).

Three reviewed studies reported crash reduction factors for the 
construction of raised medians or pedestrian islands. One study 
found that replacement of a 6-ft painted median with a wide raised 
median reduced pedestrian crashes by 23% (4), which was consis-
tent with findings from another study that pedestrian crash rates for 
roads with 10-ft medians were 33% lower than for roads with 4-ft 
painted medians (5). Finally, a before–after study was conducted 
to evaluate the safety effectiveness of raised pedestrian RIs. The 
researchers found a 73% reduction in midblock pedestrian crashes 
but a 136% increase in total crashes. They noted that the decrease in 
safety related to vehicle–island crashes might be addressed through 
better island design and lane alignment (6).

PHBs, also known as HAWK (high-intensity activated crosswalk) 
beacons, were developed by Tucson, Arizona, traffic engineer Richard 
Nassi in the late 1990s to provide safe pedestrian crossings in cases in 
which minor streets intersected with major arterials (7, 8). A PHB is a 
special type of beacon used to warn and control traffic at an unsignal-
ized location to assist pedestrians as they cross a street or highway at 
a marked crosswalk. The PHB signal head consists of two red lenses 
over a single yellow lens. It displays a red indication to drivers when 
activated, which creates a gap during which pedestrians can cross 
a major roadway. The PHB signal indication for motorists is not  
illuminated until it is activated by a pedestrian who triggers the 
warning flashing yellow lens on the major street. After a set amount 
of time, the traffic signal indication changes to a solid yellow light 
to inform drivers to prepare to stop. The beacon then displays a dual 
solid red light to drivers on the major street and a walking person 
symbol to pedestrians. At the conclusion of the walk phase, the bea-
con displays an alternating flashing red light to drivers, and pedes-
trians are shown an upraised hand symbol with a countdown display 
to inform them of the time left during which to cross. The first PHB 
was installed in Tucson in 2000. The PHB was considered an experi-
mental treatment until 2009 when it was included in the Manual on 
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (9). PHBs are now widely used in 
Tucson and have since been installed in Georgia, Minnesota, Florida, 
Michigan, Virginia, Arizona, Alaska, and Delaware (10).

One reviewed study reported crash reduction factors with respect 
to the installation of PHBs in Tucson. Results of the analysis showed 
a statistically significant reduction in total crashes of 29% as well 
as a statistically significant reduction in pedestrian crashes of 69%. 
The reduction in severe crashes was 15%, although this result was 
not statistically significant (7).

An RRFB is a type of amber LED installed to enhance pedestrian 
crossing signs at midblock crossings or unsignalized intersections. 
An RRFB can be automated or pedestrian actuated and features an 
irregular, eye-catching flash pattern to call attention to the presence of 
pedestrians. The RRFB was given interim approval as a crossing sign 
enhancement by FHWA in 2008 (11). Nine studies were reviewed. All 
of them indicated that RRFBs increased motorist yielding to pedestri-
ans, which thereby helped to reduce pedestrian–vehicle conflict (1). 
Figure 1 shows photographs of the four treatments evaluated in this 
study.

Data CoLLeCtion

The research team used multiple methods to identify cities and 
states that had installed pedestrian crossing treatments at unsignalized 
intersections. The team conducted exploratory field work to iden-
tify specific treatment and comparison sites in multiple cities across 
the United States. On the basis of detailed information obtained 
from each city, in terms of available treatments of interest for this 
study, U.S. geographic distribution of cities, and other factors, the 
14 cities selected for data collection for this study were Alexandria 
and Arlington,  Virginia;  Cambridge,  Massachusetts;  Chicago, 
Illinois; New York City; Miami and St. Petersburg, Florida; Tucson, 
Scottsdale, and Phoenix, Arizona; Portland and Eugene, Oregon; 
Charlotte, North Carolina; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The final database included 499 treatment sites and 476 com-
parison sites. Comparison sites were selected to be as similar as 
possible to the treatment sites, except that no treatment was present. 
Efforts were made to select comparison sites similar to the treat-
ment sites in terms of number of lanes, traffic volume, area type, 
nearby location, and other characteristics (e.g., at a school, bus stop, 
or shopping area). Table 1 summarizes the number of treatment and 
comparison sites that were found and coded into the database. As 
shown in Table 1, treatment sites often had combinations of two or 
more of the studied treatments.

Most of the sample sites were on roads with four or more lanes. 
Of the 975 sites, 136 (27%) treatment and 87 (18%) comparison 
sites were on two-lane roads. The project team decided to focus 
on sites with four or more lanes and pedestrian crossings on arterial 
streets and at transit stops, because these are the types of sites at 
which pedestrian crashes are more likely to occur (rather than on 
local two-lane streets) and at which pedestrian safety treatments are 
more likely to be needed.

The most common crosswalks in the database were those that had 
no marked crosswalk (e.g., at untreated comparison sites), continental-
style crosswalks, or ladder crosswalks. The transverse lines cross-
walks were found at about 100 crossing sites. Multiple crosswalk 
types (80 sites) were those that had two or more descriptive codes  
(combined); for example, a yellow crosswalk with transverse line 
markings, or a staggered crosswalk with continental markings, or a 
diagonal crosswalk with ladder markings. Most of the treatment (75%) 
and comparison (76%) sites were at intersections. Furthermore, a great 
majority of treatment and comparison sites were in suburban areas. In 
terms of transit use, approximately half the comparison sites were at 
transit stops, and 41% of treatment sites were at transit stops.

Data on pedestrian crashes and other crashes for each treatment and 
comparison study site were provided electronically by the agencies, 
as were data on annual average daily traffic (AADT). Few agencies 
were able to provide pedestrian counts. Thus pedestrian volume was 
collected in the field for 915 of the 975 sites. In the field, pedestrian 
counts were collected for 1 to 2 h. The team adjusted these short counts 
to daily volumes (i.e., 24-h volumes) on the basis of an analysis of city-
wide, full-day pedestrian counts from Charlotte and previous research 
in Seattle, Washington.

Data anaLysis anD resuLts

The aim of the analytical work was to use the most appropriate tech-
niques to estimate CMFs or CMFunctions for pedestrian-involved 
crashes and for all crashes, by type, for various treatments and 
treatment combinations.

It was quickly realized that the preferred before–after study would 
be limited in scope and robustness because of the relatively small 
sample sizes, especially for pedestrian crashes. Thus considerable 
effort was made to assemble a database for the alternative methodol-
ogy, cross-sectional regression analysis, with recognition of the well-
known limitations of this approach. In view of those limitations, it 
still was necessary to conduct a before–after study, however limited, 
to complement the cross-sectional analysis and seek to corroborate 
the results.

Although the primary target crash of the four pedestrian treatments 
was the small subset of vehicle–pedestrian crashes, vehicle–vehicle 
crashes were added to the analysis to investigate if they were affected 
as well. If the treatments altered driver behavior, it was a logical pos-
sibility. Rear-end and sideswipe crashes were combined, because it 
was hypothesized that these types of vehicle–vehicle crashes might 
be the crash types most likely to be affected by the pedestrian treat-
ments and would be similar in this regard. The combined category 
was considered the target vehicle–vehicle crash category.

CMF estimation with Before–after  
study Methodology

The empirical Bayes (EB) methodology for observational before–after 
studies was used to develop CMFs. In the EB approach, the CMF is 
estimated on the basis of a comparison of the expected number of 
crashes that would have occurred in the after period without the treat-
ment and the number of reported crashes in the after period. The first 
value is estimated in essence as a weighted average of the crashes that 
occur before treatment and the prediction from a safety performance 
function developed from a reference group of similar but untreated 
sites that is adjusted for changes in traffic volume and time trends 
between the periods before and after treatment. This methodology is 
rigorous in that it properly accounts for regression to the mean and 
these other changes and is included in the first edition of the Highway 
Safety Manual as the state of the art for the conduct of observational 
before–after studies (12) and is well documented in Hauer (13). Both 
sources can be consulted for details on the methodology, which are not 
presented here in the interests of brevity.

The evaluation was conducted for three treatments with sufficient 
sites: RI (68 sites), AS (69 sites), and PHB in combination with AS 
(27 sites). Four crash types were investigated in the before–after 
evaluation when possible: total, rear-end, sideswipe, and pedestrian. 
Table 2 shows the estimated CMFs for the RI, AS, and PHB and AS 
combination. For each treatment and crash type, the table shows the 
actual crashes that occurred during the after period, the expected 

crashes had the treatment not been implemented (estimated on the 
basis of the EB procedure), variance of the expected crashes, the 
CMF, the standard error of the CMF, and the p-value.

For the RI treatment, the EB estimate of crashes in the before 
period of the treatment group was higher than it was for the actual 
crashes, particularly so for vehicle-involved crashes, which led to an 
inexplicable increase in total crashes. This result was unexpected, 
and hence the results for the RI treatment for the vehicle-involved 
crash types were not considered reliable enough for inclusion. The 
results for pedestrian crashes indicated a reduction of approximately 
33%, which was significant at about the 13% significance level.

For the AS treatment, the results indicated an approximate 11% 
reduction in total crashes, a 20% reduction in rear-end and sideswipe 
crashes, and a 36% reduction in pedestrian crashes. The reduction in 
total crashes was statistically significant at about the 8% level, and 
the reduction in the other two crash types was statistically significant 
at the 5% level or lower.

For the combination PHB and AS treatment, the results indicated 
an approximately 18% reduction in total crashes and a 76% reduc-
tion in pedestrian crashes. Both results were statistically significant 
at the 5% level or lower. The changes in rear-end and sideswipe 
crashes were not statistically significant at any reasonable signifi-
cance level. The result for pedestrian crashes was quite consistent 
with the 69% reduction reported by Fitzpatrick and Park (7) for the 
same treatment at intersections in Tucson. Fitzpatrick and Park also 
used the EB before–after evaluation method (7).

CMF estimation from Cross-sectional 
regression analysis

The purpose of the cross-sectional regression analysis, as it was for 
the before–after study, was to estimate CMFs or CMFunctions for 
each of the four pedestrian treatments. It also was of interest to esti-
mate CMFs for combinations of treatments. In fact, at many of the 
sites one installed treatment was followed by one or more additional 
treatments in later years. For most combination treatments, how-
ever, the sample size was too limited to provide robust results. 
The exceptions were PHB and RRFBs. Most sites that had these 
treatments also had AS present. Several crash types were analyzed 
separately for each treatment, including pedestrian crashes; rear-
end plus sideswipe crashes; rear-end plus sideswipe crashes; fatal, 
incapacitating injury, nonincapacitating injury, and possible injury 
crashes; and total crashes.

The cross-sectional analysis applied generalized linear modeling. 
Because each site year of data was used as an observation, the issue of

repeated measures of the data needed to be resolved in the specifica-
tion of the models. The approach taken within the generalized linear 
modeling framework to account for the repeated measures and nested 
nature of the data was that of generalized estimation equations. This 
approach ensured that the correlation between within-site observa-
tions was accounted for and allowed for unobserved heterogeneity 
between cities.

The data set used to develop the CMFs for RIs did not include any 
site that had an AS, PHB, or RRFB installed at any time during the 
study period. For this and all treatments, the reference group sites 
did not have any of the four main treatments installed. Likewise, 
the data set used to develop CMFs for AS did not include any site 
that had an RI, PHB, or RRFB installed at any time during the study 
period. The data used to develop the CMFs for RIs and AS came 
from Alexandria and Arlington, Cambridge, Charlotte, Chicago, 
Eugene, Miami, Milwaukee, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, 
Scottsdale, St. Petersburg, and Tucson.

The data set used to develop CMFs for PHBs did not include any 
site that had an RI or RRFB installed at any time during the study 
period. Because many sites with PHBs also had AS, sites with these 
signs were included in the data set. The sites also were limited to 
the following cities in which a PHB existed: Charlotte, Portland, 
Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tucson, and St. Petersburg.

For pedestrian crash models, the data set used to develop CMFs 
for RRFBs included all locations. This data set was needed to allow 
for a sufficient sample of pedestrian crashes. For the other crash 
types, the data set for RRFBs did not include any site that had an RI 
or PHB installed at any time during the study period. Because many 
sites with RRFB also had an AS, sites with these signs were included 
in the data set. For the nonpedestrian crash models, the sites also 
were limited to cities in which an RRFB existed: Chicago, Eugene, 
Miami, Phoenix, Portland, and St. Petersburg.

Cross-sectional Model results

This section presents the CMFs implied by the relevant parameter 
estimates of the cross-section models. For brevity, only one set of 
models (RIs) is presented here by way of example. The following 
considerations were applied to the making of decisions on variables 
to include in the models.

•	 The typical multiplicative crash prediction model form even-
tually was applied with pedestrian and total AADT as separate 
power model terms and the categorical variables for the city in which 
a crossing was located, presence of a treatment, area type (urban 
or  suburban),  and  crossing  location  (midblock  or  intersection) 
as exponential terms.

•	 Interaction terms were attempted—for example, the effect of 
presence of treatment and crossing location—but these did not 
improve the model’s capability to explain the variation in crashes 
between sites.

•	 Multilevel models were attempted to develop CMFunctions 
through investigation to determine if the implied CMFs for the pres-
ence of treatment varied by vehicle and pedestrian AADT and other 
variables, but these, too, did not improve the results.

•	 A city factor variable was included in the models to account for 
differences in expected crashes between jurisdictions not related to 
the treatment, which could include crash reporting practices, weather, 
cultural issues, and the like. Inclusion of this variable estimated a 
unique intercept term for each city in a model. The same logic applied 

to the inclusion of the area type variable. Models with and without the 
city variable and the area type were attempted before it was decided 
whether to include the variable in the final models. (For the most part, 
the variable was included.)
