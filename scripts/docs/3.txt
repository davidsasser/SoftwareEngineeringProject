Exploring Vehicle–Pedestrian Crash 
Severity Factors on the Basis of  
In-Car Black Box Recording Data

Tai-Jin Song, Jaehyun (Jason) So, Jisun Lee, and Billy M. Williams

This study investigated the main factors affecting the severity of injury 
to pedestrians in taxi–pedestrian crashes on urban arterial roads. Video 
data recorded by an in-car black box were used. Because the video data 
provided direct crash observation, they were more reliable than the crash 
data, and video images and speed profiles retrieved from the black box 
were advantageous for safety studies. For analysis of the black box data, 
this study defined new explanatory variables that affected injury sever-
ity; these variables could not have been identified by the conventional 
method, which was based on crash reports. A multiple-indicator and 
multiple-cause model was used to investigate the relationship between the 
explanatory variables and injury severity. A total of 484 taxi–pedestrian 
crash scenes over 2 years was used for the multivariate analysis in the 
city of Incheon, South Korea. The crash characteristics most strongly 
associated with increased crash severity were failure by the pedestrian 
to watch for approaching vehicles, jaywalking by the pedestrian, the 
pedestrian being elderly, excessive vehicle speed, failure by the driver 
to immediately stop, limited driver vision, and nighttime. This study 
emphasized the potential of individualized black box video recording 
data for crash severity analysis and investigation of the causal factors 
of crashes.

With economic growth and technological advances, vehicle owner-
ship has dramatically increased in the past decades as more people 
possess the means to purchase private vehicles. Whereas the improve-
ment of traffic mobility was an important issue in the past, traffic 
safety has recently become a major worldwide social issue because 
of the millions of vehicle crashes and deaths every year. The World 
Health Organization publicized that approximately 1.2 million people 
died, 50 million people were injured, and 518 billion U.S. dollars of 
global social expenses were lost because of road crashes each year in 
the recent decade (1). The World Health Organization also stated that 
the road crash is not only an offshoot of vehicular mobility but also a 
major global social issue that threatens people’s lives.

The various types of traffic crashes include vehicle-to-vehicle 
crashes, vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes, and single-vehicle crashes.

Of these crash types, the vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes are an espe-
cially critical problem because the severity level of fatality and injury 
is high. According to the Road Traffic Authority in South Korea, 
45.5% of the fatal crashes that have occurred since 1990 were 
pedestrian-related crashes, and this proportion is slightly increasing 
(2). Therefore, the pedestrian-related crashes need to be taken more 
seriously within the traffic safety research community to reduce 
fatalities on roadways.

Given  such  circumstances,  several  research  efforts  have  been 
made to investigate the factors that affect crashes on the basis of 
the crash reports made by police officers through interviews with 
the people in the crash or the witnesses. However, this conventional 
method can be limited in two aspects. One is that the crash report 
does not show comprehensive information before and after a crash 
occurs because the reports are always made after a crash. Therefore, 
information about the maneuvering of the vehicle, such as speed 
and acceleration or deceleration, and the situation of the pedestrian 
before and after a crash can be limited. The other limitation is that 
the explanatory variables extracted (i.e., causes of crash) are limited 
to the crash report because the factors can be retrieved only by the 
questions asked in the crash report.

This study proposes a new data source: video recordings that can 
be obtained from black box devices mounted on the vehicles. The 
data can be used for investigating factors that affect crash severity. 
The black box is capable of not only recording video images but 
also storing the observed speed and acceleration and deceleration 
data before and after a crash. This capability is beneficial for recon-
structing and understanding the crash situations. Also, black box 
data provide comprehensive information, including variables that 
cannot be identified by the crash reports made by police officers.

Therefore, this study aims to identify new factors associated with  
vehicle–pedestrian crash severity (specifically taxi–pedestrian crashes) 
by analyzing the video recording data. The study also aims to inves-
tigate the relationship between the crash severity factors and the 
resulting crash severity by using a multiple-indicator and multiple-
cause (MIMIC) model (3). Finally, the recommendations to mitigate 
the severity of pedestrian-related crashes are discussed on the basis 
of the findings of this study. The authors expect that this in-vehicle 
black box application and the case for crash severity analysis would 
be used to improve pedestrian safety in the near future.

The  authors  reviewed  the  previous  safety  studies  focusing  on 
pedestrian–vehicle crash severity and the risk factors affecting the 
severity. Haleem et al. identified the factors affecting crash injury

severity using 3 years of pedestrian crash data in Florida, which 
were recorded by police officers (4). The risk factors considered in 
this study include geometric predictors (e.g., presence and type of 
crosswalk and presence of pedestrian refuge area), traffic predictors 
(e.g., annual average daily traffic, posted speed limit, and percentage 
of trucks), road user variables (e.g., pedestrian age and pedestrian 
maneuver  before  crash),  environmental  predictors  (e.g., weather 
and lighting conditions), and vehicle-related predictors (e.g., vehi-
cle type). The analysis was conducted with mixed logit modeling,  
and the results showed that standard crosswalks reduced crash sever-
ity 1.36% and at-fault pedestrians were more vulnerable than other 
pedestrians at unsignalized intersections. Koopmans et al. used Illi-
nois state crash data to investigate pedestrian–vehicle crash sever-
ity levels by pedestrian age (5). The crashes were categorized by 
five groups (fatal, severe, moderate, minor, and none) and by five 
age groups (younger than 5, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19, and 20 and 
older). The results indicated that the crash severity decreased as age 
increased. Niebuhr et al. also investigated pedestrian–vehicle crash 
severity with crash data from the German In-Depth Accident Study 
(6). This study categorized ages by three groups: children (0 to 14), 
adults (15 to 60), and older adults (older than 60) and analyzed the 
data by using a weighted least squares approach. The modeling results 
showed that the elderly and children were more likely to be severely 
injured than young adults. This result was also found in several other 
studies (7–10). Aziz et al. investigated the causal factors affecting 
pedestrian–vehicle injury severity using New York City crash data 
(11). This study used a random parameter logit model to explain the 
relationship between possible factors and the injury severity. The mod-
eling results showed that road characteristics (e.g., number of lanes, 
grade, light condition, road surface), traffic attributes (e.g., presence 
of signal control, type of vehicle), and land use (e.g., parking facilities, 
commercial and industrial land use) were statistically significant, indi-
cating that these variables significantly affected the injury severity of 
pedestrians. Al-Ghamdi investigated the characteristics of pedestrian–
vehicle crashes on the basis of police reports and the hospital records 
of victims from 1997 to 1999 (12). The crash data were analyzed by 
two odds ratio techniques, Woolf’s and Mantel–Haenszel’s, and the 
analysis showed that young and old age groups (1 to 9 years, 10 to 
19 years, and 60 to 80 years) are at a higher risk of being involved 
in pedestrian–vehicle crashes. Zajac and Ivan used an ordered pro-
bit model to evaluate the effect of roadway and area type features on 
injury severity of pedestrian crashes (13). The pedestrian crash data 
were obtained from the Connecticut Department of Transportation 
Office of Inventory and Forecasting. The injury severity level of these 
crashes were coded with the KABCO injury scale (14), consisting of 
the following five severity levels:

•	 K = fatality (killed);
•	 A = incapacitating or disabling injury, cannot leave the scene 
without assistance (e.g., broken bones, severe cuts, unconsciousness);
•	 B =  nonincapacitating  or  nondisabling  injury,  but  visible 

(e.g., minor cuts, swelling, limping, bruises and abrasions);

•	 C = possible injury, but not visible (e.g., complaint of pain or 

momentary unconsciousness); and

•	 O = property damage only, no injury.

The roadway and area type variables of each crash data set were 
paired with the KABCO scale. The analysis showed that five features 
(roadway width, vehicle type, driver alcohol involvement, elderly 
pedestrian, and pedestrian alcohol involvement) appeared to signifi-

cantly affect the pedestrian’s injury severity, and the crashes of those 
who were severely injured occurred more frequently in downtown 
and compact residential areas. Zhang et al. also investigated factors 
affecting the severity of vehicle traffic crashes involving the elderly 
(15). The crash data used for this study were obtained from the Cana-
dian Traffic Accident Information Databank, compiled from police 
crash reports in Ontario, Canada. On the basis of the multivariate 
unconditional logistic regression analysis, the study indicated that 
several factors were significantly related to an increased risk of fatal 
injury in crashes. The factors were age, sex, failing to yield right-
of-way or disobeying traffic signs, nonuse of seat belts, ejection 
from vehicle, intersection without traffic controls, roads with higher 
speed limits, snowy weather, head-on collisions, two-vehicle turn-
ing collisions, overtaking, and changing lanes. Many studies have 
been conducted to identify the factors affecting pedestrian-involved 
crashes or injury severity by employing different statistical model-
ing approaches: a zero-inflated Poisson distribution (16), a clas-
sification and regression tree (17), a heteroskedastic generalized 
extreme value model (18), and an ordered logit model (19). All the 
safety studies reviewed in this section were conducted on the basis 
of police-recorded crash data.

There is another stream to analyze traffic situations during crashes. 
An event data recorder (EDR) has been recently highlighted for post-
crash analysis, mainly to investigate vehicle maneuvers during the 
crash situations (20–23). The data extracted from an EDR provide 
vehicle trajectories, including speed information such as the change 
in velocity before and after a crash occurs, without images. Sev-
eral studies used EDR data to reconstruct crashes and understand 
vehicle maneuvers performed during the crashes (20, 21, 23, 24). 
The key purpose of investigation of these studies was to estimate 
change of velocity in categorizing serious and nonserious occupant  
injury (20, 25).

Some studies used an automated video-based computer vision 
technique to reconstruct crash scenes and analyze the causes (26, 27). 
This work can detect the movements of the road entities, including 
pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles across an intersection. How-
ever, the main obstacle of using this technique lies in the ability of 
video-based data collection.

The authors found one study that used black box video record-
ing data. Chung and Chang used a vehicle black box to assess 
the accuracy of police-recorded crash data by comparing them 
with  the  crash  data  recorded  by  the  black  box  (28).  This  study 
extracted pedestrian–taxi crash data from the crash data recorded 
by  the  black box and used them as a ground truth to assess the 
accuracy of data from police reports. This study found that the spa-
tial (i.e., crash location) and temporal (i.e., crash timing) average 
deviations between the black box data and the police-recorded data 
were 84.84 m and 29.05 min, and the average speed error (i.e., right 
before a crash occurs) was 9.03 km/h.

From  the  literature  review,  significant  efforts  have  been  made 
to identify the factors affecting crash severity and the relationship 
between potential factors and the resulting crash severity. However, 
most previous safety studies relied on the crash reports made by 
police officers or governmental authorities; this reliance can limit 
the study in the consideration of potential additional factors that are 
not listed in the crash reports. Also, because the questionnaire for 
a crash report is answered after a crash, the method based on crash 
reports cannot account for the whole crash situation, including before 
and after the crash. Whereas the conventional crash report method 
has such limitations, the data from black box video recordings can 
provide additional factors that could not be identified from the crash

reports. Also, because EDR is not capable of providing images, the 
video recording data are expected to be a promising new source of 
data for crash analysis. Therefore, this study investigated the potential 
benefits of the video recording data on crash severity analysis.

system, how they are slightly different from the most advanced EDR, 
and data combination processing for two heterogeneous crash data 
sources (i.e., police-recorded data and black box-recorded data) (28).

MethodoLogies

data Collection

Black box video data were recorded using the Bosch X-DRIVEN 
commercial driving recording device (29). This device and the 
deployed software not only record videos, including images and 
sound, but also collect vehicle trajectories, such as speed, accelera-
tion and deceleration, and latitude and longitude, with the resolu-
tion of 0.1 s. The black box video data were collected for 2 years 
(2010 and 2011) in the city of Incheon, South Korea, by the Incheon 
Taxi Mutual Aid Association, which was established by taxi drivers 
for enhancing drivers’ welfare. This organization recently installed 
black box devices in their vehicles to better respond to possible 
legal issues when crashes occur. Because the video recording data 
were extracted from the black boxes installed on taxis, this study 
used only the crashes involving taxis and pedestrians; 484 crashes 
were collected for the study.

Whereas conventional safety studies rely on police crash reports, 
the black box data enabled the authors to observe comprehensive 
crash-related information by providing continuous crash scenes 
before and after crashes. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of one black 
box video that recorded a crash between a taxi and a child. In this 
screenshot, continuous video data streams are provided in the top 
left corner; three-dimensional acceleration information with 0.1-s 
time resolution is provided on the bottom of the video stream; instan-
taneous speeds 30 s before and after the crash are provided in the 
middle of the bottom in the screenshot; and latitudinal and longi-
tudinal information are shown in the right corner of Figure 1. From 
this continuous video data stream, additional information that police 
reports cannot provide can be obtained: the child did not recognize 
that the taxi was coming; the driver was driving at 7.1 km/h; the 
driver did not take evasive action; and the vehicle failed to stop and 
drove 5 m more after the crash. Much additional information was 
collected by analyzing the black box data, and this crash information 
yielded variables in the crash severity model developed in this study. 
For more detailed information, Chung and Chang introduced vehicle 
black box technology used in this study, including the black box 

variable selection

Both dependent and independent variables were defined and extracted 
through analysis of the black box video data. As for the dependent 
variables, the crashes were categorized by four levels of crash sever-
ity: death (within 30 days of the crash), incapacitating injury (requir-
ing hospitalization of 3 weeks or more), visible injury (requiring 
hospitalization from 5 days to 3 weeks), and claim pain (requiring 
hospitalization of less than 5 days). In addition, the pedestrian’s 
impairment level, indicating whether the pedestrian could stand up 
without assistance, which was observed through the video recordings, 
was used as a dependent variable. Therefore, two dependent variables 
were used to develop the crash severity model.

For the independent variables, there are four categories: pedes-
trian characteristics, driver characteristics, crash condition, and time 
period. Detailed variables for each independent variable category are 
presented, with mean and standard deviation of the collected data, 
in Table 1. A data reduction process was conducted to include only 
valid crash data and exclude exceptions, such as the crashes with 
unknown factors caused by poor video quality or limited range of 
the black box. For example, the data were excluded in the following 
cases: pedestrians went out of the vision of the black box after a crash 
or pedestrians are unseen because the video is not bright enough 
(e.g., at night or in shadow) or is of low quality.

study hypotheses

New variables that could account for crash severity were extracted, 
as presented in Table 1. These variables explain the possible con-
tributing factors before and after a crash. Specifically, a pedestrian’s 
level of impairment and a vehicle’s failure to stop can build on the 
assumption that a pedestrian who experiences a crash was not appro-
priately walking or running, and the driver also may not immediately 
stop the vehicle if the crash results in a severe condition. Additional 
hypotheses were made as follows:

•	 Pedestrian behavior on injury severity. Injury severity would 

increase if the pedestrian

– Could not check if a vehicle was approaching,
– Was running (instead of walking),
– Was jaywalking (illegally crossing midblock),
– Was younger than 14 years old, or
– Was older than 65 years old.

•	 Vehicle maneuvers on injury severity. Injury severity would 

increase if

– The vehicle’s speed was higher or
– A vehicle failed to immediately stop after a crash.

•	 Driver  behavior  on  injury  severity.  Injury  severity  would 

increase if

– The vehicle ran a red light (red light running violation),
– The driver could not see a pedestrian crossing because of 

limited vision, or

– The crash occurred at night.

With these hypotheses in mind, the behaviors of both pedestrians 

and drivers were thoroughly observed by the authors.
