Analyzing pedestrian crash injury severity at signalized and non-signalized locations  

This study identiﬁes and compares the signiﬁcant factors affecting pedestrian crash injury severity at signalized 
and unsignalized intersections. The factors explored include geometric predictors (e.g., presence and type of crosswalk 
and presence of pedestrian refuge area), trafﬁc predictors (e.g., annual average daily trafﬁc (AADT), speed limit, and 
percentage of trucks), road user variables (e.g., pedestrian age and pedestrian maneuver before crash), environmental
predictors (e.g., weather and lighting conditions), and vehicle-related predictors (e.g., vehicle type). The analysis 
was conducted using the mixed logit model, which allows the parameter estimates to randomly vary across the observations.
The study used three years of pedestrian crash data from Florida. Police reports were reviewed in detail to have a better 
understanding of how each pedestrian crash occurred. Additionally, information that is unavailable in the crash records, 
such as at-fault road user and pedestrian maneuver, was collected. At signalized intersections, higher AADT, speed limit, 
and percentage of trucks; very old pedestrians; at-fault pedestrians; rainy weather; and dark lighting condition were 
associated with higher pedestrian severity risk. For example, a one-percent higher truck percentage increases the probability 
of severe injuries by 1.37%. A one-mile-per-hour higher speed limit increases the probability of severe injuries by 1.22%. 
At unsignalized intersections, pedestrian walking along roadway, middle and very old pedestrians, at-fault pedestrians, 
vans, dark lighting condition, and higher speed limit were associated with higher pedestrian severity risk. On the other 
hand, standard crosswalks were associated with 1.36% reduction in pedestrian severe injuries. Several countermeasures 
to reduce pedestrian injury severity are recommended. 

1.   Introduction
Pedestrian   safety   is   of   particular   concern   to   Florida   as   one   in every   ﬁve   trafﬁc-related   fatalities  
in
 
the
 
state
 
is
 
a
 
pedestrian
(Fatality
 
Analysis
 
Reporting
 
System
 
“FARS”,
 
2012).
 
According
 
to
 
the
National
 
Highway
 
Trafﬁc
 
Safety
 
Administration
 
(NHTSA,
 
2009),
Florida
 
had
 
the
 
highest
 
pedestrian
 
fatalities
 
per
 
capita
 
in
 
the
United
 
States
 
(U.S.)
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
2009
 
statistics
 
of
 
2.51
 
pedestrian
fatalities
 
per
 
100,000
 
population.
 
Another
 
recent
 
study
 
by
Transportation
 
for
 
America
 
(T4A,
 
2011)
 
has
 
ranked
 
Florida
 
as
the
 
most
 
dangerous
 
state
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
for
 
pedestrians.
 
The
 
same
study
 
ranked
 
52
 
large
 
metropolitan
 
areas
 
with
 
over
 
1
 
million
population.
 
In
 
this
 
ranking,
 
the
 
top
 
four
 
regions
 
were
 
located
 
in
Florida.
 
This
 
ranking
 
was
 
given
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
Pedestrian
 
Danger
Index
 
(PDI),
 
which
 
computes
 
the
 
rate
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
deaths
 
relative
to
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
walk-to-work
 
trips
 
in
 
an
 
area.
As
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
typically
 
involve
 
injury,
 
one
 
way
 
to
analyze
 
a
 
pedestrian
 
safety
 
issue
 
is
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
signiﬁcant
factors
 
affecting
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
injury
 
severity
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
select
the
 
appropriate
 
countermeasures.
 
This
 
paper
 
identiﬁes
 
signiﬁcant
factors
 
affecting
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
 
at
 
signalized
 
and
unsignalized
 
intersections
 
using
 
three
 
years
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
crash
data
 
(2008–2010)
 
from
 
Florida.
 
The
 
paper
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
relative
risk
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
absolute
 
risk
 
of
 
a
vehicle–pedestrian
 
crash.
 
The
 
analysis
 
was
 
performed
 
separately
for
 
signalized
 
and
 
unsignalized
 
intersections
 
to
 
identify
 
and
compare
 
the
 
signiﬁcant
 
factors
 
affecting
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity.

Prior
 
research
This
 
section
 
reviews
 
the
 
literature
 
on
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
analysis.
 
It
 
speciﬁcally
 
focuses
 
on
 
studies
 
that
 
explored
 
the
 
risk
factors
 
affecting
 
severity
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
and
 
those
 
that
applied
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
approach.
Zajac
 
and
 
Ivan
 
(2003)
 
used
 
the
 
ordered
 
probit
 
model
 
to
evaluate
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
roadway
 
features
 
on
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
injury
severity
 
in
 
rural
 
Connecticut.
 
The
 
signiﬁcant
 
variables
 
included
roadway
 
width,
 
vehicle
 
type,
 
alcohol
 
involvement,
 
and
 
pedestrian
age.
 
Using
 
the
 
same
 
approach,
 
Mohamed
 
et
 
al.
 
(2013)
 
used
 
two
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
 
datasets
 
from
 
New
 
York
 
City,
 
U.S.
(2002–2006)
 
and
 
Montreal,
 
Canada
 
(2003–2006)
 
and
 
applied
 
the
ordered
 
probit
 
and
 
multinomial
 
logit
 
models
 
to
 
analyze
 
severity
of
 
pedestrian
 
crashes.
 
Several
 
common
 
variables,
 
such
 
as
presence
 
of
 
heavy
 
vehicles,
 
absence
 
of
 
lighting,
 
and
 
prevalence
of
 
mixed
 
land
 
use,
 
were
 
found
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
fatal
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
in
 
both
 
cities.
Oh
 
et
 
al.
 
(2005)
 
identiﬁed
 
the
 
signiﬁcant
 
factors
 
affecting
 
the
probability
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
fatalities
 
in
 
Korea
 
using
 
a
 
logistic
regression
 
model.
 
They
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
collision
 
speed
 
was
 
the
most
 
signiﬁcant
 
factor,
 
where
 
a
 
higher
 
speed
 
was
 
associated
 
with
 
a
pedestrian
 
fatality
 
increase.
 
This
 
result
 
was
 
consistent
 
with
 
Garder
(2004),
 
and
 
was
 
conﬁrmed
 
by
 
Strandroth
 
et
 
al.
 
(2011)
 
and
 
Zhao
et
 
al.
 
(2013).
 
Sarkar
 
et
 
al.
 
(2011)
 
also
 
developed
 
binary
 
logistic
regression
 
models
 
to
 
identify
 
pedestrian
 
fatality
 
risk
 
factors
 
along
Bangladesh’s
 
roadways
 
using
 
crash
 
data
 
from
 
1998
 
to
 
2006.
 
The
authors
 
found
 
an
 
increased
 
likelihood
 
of
 
a
 
fatality
 
risk
 
among
elderly
 
pedestrians
 
(i.e.,
 
older
 
than
 
55
 
years)
 
and
 
young
pedestrians
 
(i.e.,
 
younger
 
than
 
15
 
years).
 
A
 
higher
 
risk
 
of
 
fatality
was
 
observed
 
for
 
pedestrians
 
who
 
crossed
 
the
 
road
 
compared
 
to
those
 
who
 
walked
 
along
 
the
 
road.
 
Pedestrian
 
crashes
 
involving
trucks,
 
buses,
 
and
 
tractors
 
had
 
a
 
higher
 
fatality
 
risk
 
compared
 
to
cars.
 
Furthermore,
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
occurring
 
at
 
locations
 
with
no
 
trafﬁc
 
control
 
or
 
stop
 
control
 
had
 
a
 
higher
 
fatality
 
risk
 
than
those
 
occurring
 
at
 
signalized
 
intersections.
Tarko
 
and
 
Azam
 
(2011)
 
linked
 
both
 
police
 
and
 
hospital
 
crash
injury
 
data
 
to
 
identify
 
signiﬁcant
 
injury
 
risk
 
predictors
 
by
 
applying
the
 
bivariate
 
probit
 
model.
 
The
 
authors
 
found
 
that
 
male
 
and
 
older
pedestrians
 
were
 
more
 
prone
 
to
 
severe
 
injuries
 
compared
 
to
 
other
groups.
 
Rural
 
and
 
high-speed
 
urban
 
roadways
 
were
 
found
 
to
 
be
more
 
dangerous
 
for
 
pedestrians,
 
especially
 
for
 
pedestrians
crossing
 
the
 
roadways.
 
The
 
most
 
dangerous
 
pedestrian
 
behavior
was
 
identiﬁed
 
to
 
be
 
crossing
 
a
 
road
 
between
 
intersections
 
(i.e.,
 
at
midblock
 
locations).
 
In
 
addition,
 
the
 
size
 
and
 
weight
 
of
 
the
 
vehicle
involved
 
in
 
a
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
were
 
signiﬁcant
 
predictors
 
of
pedestrian
 
injury
 
level.
 
Similar
 
ﬁndings
 
were
 
observed
 
by
Al-Shammari
 
et
 
al.
 
(2009)
 
who
 
investigated
 
risk
 
factors
 
of
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
 
in
 
Riyadh,
 
Saudi
 
Arabia
 
over
 
three-year
period.
 
Results
 
showed
 
that
 
men
 
were
 
at
 
a
 
signiﬁcantly
 
greater
 
risk
than
 
women
 
in
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
involvement
 
and
 
two-thirds
 
of
pedestrians
 
were
 
struck
 
while
 
crossing
 
the
 
road.
Nasar
 
and
 
Troyer
 
(2013)
 
hypothesized
 
that
 
pedestrians
 
could
experience
 
reduced
 
awareness
 
of
 
surroundings,
 
distraction,
 
and
engage
 
in
 
unsafe
 
behavior
 
while
 
talking
 
or
 
texting
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
phones.
 
Using
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Consumer
 
Product
 
Safety
Commission
 
on
 
injuries
 
in
 
hospital
 
emergency
 
rooms
 
from
2004
 
to
 
2010,
 
they
 
found
 
that
 
mobile
 
phone-related
 
injuries
among
 
pedestrians
 
increased
 
relative
 
to
 
total
 
pedestrian
 
injuries.
Moreover,
 
pedestrian
 
injuries
 
related
 
to
 
mobile
 
phone
 
use
 
were
higher
 
for
 
males
 
and
 
for
 
people
 
under
 
31
 
years
 
of
 
age.
 
Similarly,
Byington
 
and
 
Schwebel
 
(2013)
 
concluded
 
that
 
pedestrian
 
behavior
was
 
considered
 
riskier
 
while
 
simultaneously
 
using
 
mobile
 
internet
and
 
crossing
 
the
 
street
 
than
 
when
 
crossing
 
the
 
street
 
with
 
no
distraction. Several
 
studies,
 
including
 
Lee
 
and
 
Abdel-Aty
 
(2005)
 
and
Jang
 
et
 
al.
 
(2013),
 
analyzed
 
both
 
frequency
 
and
 
severity
 
of
pedestrian
 
crashes.
 
Lee
 
and
 
Abdel-Aty
 
(2005)
 
analyzed
 
the
frequency
 
and
 
injury
 
severity
 
of
 
vehicle–pedestrian
 
crashes
 
at
intersections
 
in
 
Florida
 
using
 
four
 
years
 
of
 
data
 
from
 
1999
 
to
 
2002.
Some
 
of
 
the
 
signiﬁcant
 
factors
 
affecting
 
crash
 
injury
 
severity
included
 
pedestrian
 
age,
 
weather
 
and
 
lighting
 
conditions,
 
and
vehicle
 
size.
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
authors
 
found
 
that
 
pedestrian
injuries
 
involving
 
a
 
large
 
vehicle
 
were
 
more
 
severe
 
than
 
those
involving
 
a
 
passenger
 
car.
Jang
 
et
 
al.
 
(2013)
 
used
 
six
 
years
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
from
2002
 
to
 
2007
 
in
 
San
 
Francisco,
 
California
 
to
 
identify
 
risk
 
factors
that
 
affect
 
the
 
frequency
 
and
 
severity
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
crashes.
 
They
used
 
an
 
ordered
 
probit
 
model
 
and
 
found
 
that
 
alcohol
 
involvement,
cell
 
phone
 
use,
 
and
 
age
 
(either
 
below
 
15
 
years
 
or
 
above
 
65
 
years)
increased
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity.
 
Environmental
 
character
istics
 
that
 
were
 
associated
 
with
 
high
 
pedestrian
 
severity
 
included
nighttime,
 
weekends,
 
and
 
rainy
 
weather.
 
The
 
authors
 
also
 
found
that
 
larger
 
vehicles
 
such
 
as
 
pickups,
 
trucks,
 
and
 
buses
 
were
associated
 
with
 
greater
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severities
 
compared
 
to
passenger
 
cars. Roudsari
 et
 
al.
 
(2005)
 
evaluated
 
the
 
association
 
between
 
the
manner
 
of
 
collision
 
and
 
the
 
severity
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
injuries.
 
For
passenger
 
cars,
 
they
 
found
 
that
 
colliding
 
with
 
the
 
hood
 
surface
 
and
windshield
 
in
 
pedestrian–vehicle
 
crashes
 
is
 
the
 
major
 
scenario
contributing
 
to
 
pedestrian
 
injuries.
 
A
 
similar
 
study
 
was
 
performed
by
 
Roudsari
 
et
 
al.
 
(2006),
 
who
 
evaluated
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
pre-crash
maneuver
 
on
 
pedestrian
 
severity.
 
They
 
found
 
that
 
vehicles
 
going
straight
 
and
 
striking
 
pedestrians
 
were
 
associated
 
with
 
relatively
more
 
pedestrian
 
fatalities.
To
 
more
 
accurately
 
identify
 
signiﬁcant
 
risk
 
predictors
 
of
 
crash
injury
 
severity,
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
models
 
have
 
been
 
implemented
 
in
recent
 
injury
 
severity
 
studies.
 
The
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
is
characterized
 
by
 
its
 
capability
 
to
 
account
 
for
 
unobserved
predictors
 
in
 
severity
 
studies
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
difﬁculty
 
in
 
quantifying
some
 
features,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
pedestrian
 
and
 
driver
 
behavior
 
at
 
the
time
 
of
 
the
 
crash
 
(Kim
 
et
 
al.,
 
2011).
 
The
 
application
 
of
 
the
 
mixed
logit
 
model
 
in
 
injury
 
severity
 
studies
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
in
 
Gkritza
 
and
Mannering
 
(2008),
 
Milton
 
et
 
al.
 
(2008),
 
Pai
 
et
 
al.
 
(2009),
 
Moore
et
 
al.
 
(2011),
 
Kim
 
et
 
al.
 
(2011),
 
Haleem
 
and
 
Gan
 
(2013),
 
and
Shaheed
 
et
 
al.
 
(2013).
 
One
 
study
 
that
 
applied
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
approach
 
to
 
analyze
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
 
was
 
performed
 
by
Kim
 
et
 
al.
 
(2010).
 
The
 
authors
 
used
 
four-year
 
police-reported
crashes
 
in
 
North
 
Carolina
 
from
 
1997
 
to
 
2000.
 
They
 
found
 
several
predictors
 
to
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
fatal
 
(or
 
severe)
 
injuries.
 
Examples
of
 
these
 
predictors
 
include
 
darkness
 
without
 
streetlights,
 
trucks
and
 
sport
 
utility
 
vehicles,
 
speeding
 
involvement,
 
freeway
sections,
 
and
 
increase
 
in
 
pedestrian
 
age.
The
 
above-discussed
 
review
 
suggests
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
relatively
large
 
amount
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
risk
 
literature.
 
However,
 
there
 
is
 
no
study
 
that
 
emphasizes
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
contributing
 
factors
 
included
 
in
this
 
study
 
that
 
affect
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
injury
 
severity
 
at
 
signalized
and
 
unsignalized
 
intersections.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
factors,
 
such
 
as
 
the
at-fault
 
road
 
user
 
and
 
crosswalk
 
type,
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
studied.
 
One
reason
 
may
 
be
 
because
 
these
 
data
 
are
 
not
 
typically
 
available
 
in
 
the
crash
 
and
 
roadway
 
databases.
 
This
 
study
 
was
 
made
 
possible
through
 
a
 
major
 
data
 
collection
 
effort
 
including
 
detailed
 
review
 
of
police
 
reports
 
and
 
collection
 
of
 
roadway
 
conditions
 
through
satellite
 
and
 
roadway
 
images
 
and
 
Google
 
Street
 
View.
 
The
 
police
sketches
 
and

Mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
speciﬁcation
As
 
documented
 
in
 
Kim
 
et
 
al.
 
(2010),
 
the
 
traditional
 
approaches
of
 
modeling
 
injury
 
severity
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
multinomial
 
logit
 
and
nested
 
logit
 
models
 
assume
 
that
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
each
 
variable
 
is
constant
 
across
 
the
 
observations.
 
While
 
these
 
approaches
 
have
been
 
applied
 
in
 
many
 
severity
 
studies
 
(e.g.,
 
Ulfarsson
 
and
Mannering,
 
2004;
 
Abdel-Aty
 
and
 
Abdelwahab,
 
2004),
 
they
 
cannot
model
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
unobserved
 
predictors,
 
such
 
as
 
pedestrian
behavior,
 
driver
 
behavior,
 
and
 
variables
 
that
 
can
 
capture
 
what
happens
 
just
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
crash
 
or
 
during
 
the
 
crash
 
(for
 
example,
microscopic
 
trafﬁc
 
ﬂow
 
variables
 
that
 
represent
 
the
 
trafﬁc
volume
 
in
 
very
 
small
 
periods,
 
e.g.,
 
in
 
15-min
 
intervals).
 
Failure
to
 
account
 
for
 
these
 
predictors
 
can
 
introduce
 
unobserved
heterogeneity
 
and
 
can
 
yield
 
biased
 
and
 
inefﬁcient
 
parameter
estimates
 
(Shaheed
 
et
 
al.,
 
2013).
To
 
better
 
account
 
for
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
unobserved
 
predictors,
unobserved
 
heterogeneity,
 
and
 
the
 
spatiotemporal
 
variability
 
of
the
 
observed
 
predictors,
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
is
 
applied
 
in
 
this
study.
 
This
 
model
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
a
 
random
 
error
 
term
 
that
allows
 
the
 
parameter
 
estimates
 
to
 
randomly
 
vary
 
across
 
the
 
crash
observations
 
for
 
more
 
reliable
 
parameter
 
estimates
 
(McFadden
and
 
Train,
 
2000;
 
Train,
 
2009;
 
Malyshkina
 
and
 
Mannering,
 
2010).
This
 
study
 
follows
 
the
 
methodology
 
discussed
 
by
 
Train
 
(2009).
The
 
random
 
utility
 
function
 
(Ujn)
 
that
 
deﬁnes
 
the
 
crash
 
injury
severity
 
category
 
j
 
probability
 
(severe
 
injury
 
or
 
non-severe
 
injury)
for
 
crash
 
n
 
is
 
as
 
shown
 
in
 
Eq.
 
(1).
 
Non-severe
 
injury
 
includes
property
 
damage
 
only
 
(PDO),
 
possible
 
injury,
 
and
 
non
incapacitating
 
injury,
 
while
 
severe
 
injury
 
includes
 
incapacitating
and
 
fatal
 
injuries.
Ujn ¼
 
b0 jXjn þ
 
ejn (1)
where b0 j =
 
vector
 
of
 
parameters
 
to
 
be
 
estimated;
Xjn =
 
vector
 
of
 
explored
 
variables
 
(geometric,
 
trafﬁc,
 
environ
mental,
 
pedestrian/driver-related,
 
and
 
vehicle-related);
 
and
ejn =
 
random
 
error
 
term
 
that
 
is
 
iid
 
(independently
 
and
identically-distributed)
 
generalized
 
extreme
 
value
 
(see
 
McFadden,
1981). Based
 
on
 
Train
 
(2009),
 
the
 
choice
 
probability
 
would
 
be
 
the
standard
 
multinomial
 
logit
 
since
 
ejn is
 
iid
 
extreme
 
value.
 
For
 
this,
the
 
logit
 
probability
 
conditioned
 
on
 
bj [i.e.,
 
LjnðbjÞ]
 
from
 
both
injury
 
severity
 
categories
 
J
 
(for
 
severe
 
and
 
non-severe
 
injuries)
 
is:
LjnðbjÞ
 
¼
 
Pjn
Xjn bj 
 
!¼ expðb0 jXjnÞ X J expðb0 jXjnÞ
(2)
However,
 
bj is
 
unknown
 
and
 
the
 
choice
 
probability
 
cannot
 
be
conditioned
 
on
 
bj.
 
Thus,
 
the
 
unconditional
 
choice
 
probability,
 
also
known
 
as
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
probability,
 
is
 
the
 
integral
 
of
 
Pjn over
 
all
possible
 
values
 
of
 
bj,
 
as
 
follows:
Pjn ¼Z expðb0 jXjnÞ X J expðb0 jXjnÞ
f
bj u 
 
!dbj (3)
where
 
f
 
ðbj=uÞ
 
is
 
the
 
density
 
function
 
of
 
bj,
 
and
 
u
 
is
 
the
 
vector
 
of
parameters
 
for
 
the
 
assumed
 
distribution
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
mean
 
and
variance
 
for
 
the
 
normal
 
distribution).
The
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
is
 
a
 
generalization
 
(or
 
a
 
more
 
ﬂexible
pattern)
 
of
 
the
 
multinomial
 
logit
 
model
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
parameter
variations
 
across
 
the
 
observations
 
(see
 
Train,
 
2009;
 
McFadden,
1981).
 
This
 
model
 
allows
 
for
 
the
 
variation
 
within
 
the
 
data
 
by
varying
 
bj across
 
the
 
crash
 
observations.
 
In
 
this
 
model,
 
some
parameters
 
are
 
held
 
ﬁxed
 
and
 
some
 
are
 
randomly-distributed.
Note
 
that
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
reduces
 
to
 
the
 
traditional
multinomial
 
logit
 
model
 
if
 
the
 
random
 
parameters
 
in
 
the
 
mixed
logit
 
model
 
are
 
held
 
ﬁxed
 
(Shaheed
 
et
 
al.,
 
2013).
 
The
 
multinomial
logit
 
model
 
suffers
 
from
 
the
 
independence
 
of
 
irrelevant
alternatives
 
(IIA)
 
constraint,
 
while
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
does
not
 
(Washington
 
et
 
al.,
 
2011;
 
Shaheed
 
et
 
al.,
 
2013).
 
The
 
IIA
constraint
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
ratio
 
of
 
probabilities
 
of
 
choosing
 
any
 
two
alternatives
 
(e.g.,
 
i
 
and
 
j)
 
from
 
the
 
entire
 
set
 
of
 
alternatives
 
is
independent
 
on
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
a
 
third
 
alternative
 
(h).
The
 
choice
 
probability
 
in
 
Eq.
 
(3)
 
cannot
 
be
 
easily
 
calculated
because
 
the
 
integral
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
closed
 
form
 
(Hensher
 
and
Greene,
 
2002).
 
The
 
integral
 
is
 
thus
 
approximated
 
through
simulation,
 
as
 
follows
 
(Train,
 
2009):
a. Draw
 
a
 
value
 
of
 
bj from
 
f
 
ðbj=uÞ
 
and
 
label
 
it
 
br,
 
with
 
r
 
denoting
the
 
ﬁrst
 
draw. b. Calculate
 the
 logit
 
probability
 
LjnðbrÞ
 
for
 
this
 
draw
 
using
 
Eq.
 
(2).
c. Repeat
 
steps
 
(a)
 
and
 
(b)
 
multiple
 
times
 
and
 
average
 
the
 
results
 
of
LjnðbrÞ.
 
The
 
average
 
unbiased
 
simulated
 
probability
 
estimator
(^ Pjn)
 
is
 
thus:
^ Pjn ¼
1 RX R r¼1 LjnðbrÞ
 
(4)
where
 
R
 
is
 
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
draws
 
(simulations).
The
 
log-likelihood
 
(LL)
 
of
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
can
 
be
estimated
 
as
 
shown
 
below:
LL
 
¼X N n¼1X J j¼1 lnðPjnÞ
 
(5)
Furthermore,
 
the
 
simulated
 
log-likelihood
 
(SLL)
 
is
 
estimated
 
as
follows:
SLL
 
¼X N n¼1X J j¼1 djnlnð^ PjnÞ
 
(6)
where
 
djn =
 
1
 
if
 
a
 
crash
 
n
 
has
 
an
 
injury
 
severity
 
j,
 
and
 
0
 
otherwise.
The
 
maximum
 
simulated
 
likelihood
 
estimator
 
(MSLE)
 
is
 
the
 
value
of
 
u
 
that
 
maximizes
 
SLL
 
in
 
Eq.
 
(6)
 
(Train,
 
2009).
The
 
simulation
 
procedure
 
in
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
is
 
based
 
on
Halton
 
draws.
 
The
 
Halton
 
sequence
 
is
 
a
 
deterministic
 
method
 
that
produces
 
equally-spaced
 
draws
 
in
 
the
 
unit
 
interval
 
and
 
uses
 
a
prime
 
number
 
as
 
its
 
base.
 
For
 
example,
 
to
 
generate
 
the
 
sequence
for
 
prime
 
number
 
3,
 
the
 
unit
 
interval
 
(0,1)
 
is
 
divided
 
in
 
thirds,
then
 
ninths,
 
twenty-sevenths,
 
etc.
 
A
 
Halton
 
sequence
 
is
 
created
for
 
each
 
dimension
 
of
 
the
 
mixing
 
distribution
 
(Train,
 
1999).
 
For
example,
 
if
 
the
 
mixing
 
distribution
 
includes
 
two
 
random
parameters,
 
two
 
Halton
 
sequences
 
are
 
constructed.
 
The
 
length
of
 
each
 
sequence
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
observations
and
 
the
 
numbers
 
of
 
draws
 
(R)
 
speciﬁed.
 
For
 
n
 
crash
 
observations,
R
 
draws
 
are
 
created
 
per
 
observation,
 
yielding
 
a
 
sequence
 
of
 
length
(n
 

 
R).
 
The
 
random
 
parameters
 
are
 
then
 
estimated
 
by
 
taking
 
the
inverse
 
of
 
the
 
cumulative
 
normal
 
distribution
 
of
 
each
 
element
 
in
the
 
sequence
 
(e.g.,
 
1/3,
 
1/9,
 
etc.).
The
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
was
 
ﬁtted
 
while
 
considering
 
the
 
normal
distribution
 
of
 
the
 
parameters
 
as
 
random
 
parameters
 
since
 
this
yielded
 
better-ﬁtted
 
parameter
 
estimates
 
than
 
the
 
uniform
 
and
triangular
 
distributions.
 
The
 
parameter
 
estimates
 
of
 
a
 
mixed
 
logit
model
 
were
 
computed
 
using
 
200
 
Halton
 
draws
 
for
 
building
 
the
model.
 
However,
 
1000
 
Halton
 
draws
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
ﬁt
 
the
 
ﬁnal
model.
 
The
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
was
 
ﬁtted
 
using
 
the
 
LIMDEP
software
 
package
 
(Econometric
 
Software,
 
Inc,
 
2013).
 
A
 
10%
 
level
 
of
signiﬁcance
 
was
 
used
 
to
 
keep
 
as
 
many
 
signiﬁcant
 
variables
 
as

possible
 
in
 
the
 
model
 
(since
 
the
 
objective
 
is
 
to
 
identify
 
the
signiﬁcant
 
factors
 
of
 
crash
 
injury
 
severity
 
at
 
signalized
 
and
unsignalized
 
intersections).
For
 
the
 
normal
 
distribution
 
of
 
the
 
random
 
parameters,
 
the
probability
 
that
 
the
 
distribution
 
is
 
less
 
than
 
zero
 
can
 
be
 
calculated
using
 
the
 
common
 
standard
 
normal
 
distribution
 
(Z-formula):
Z
 
¼
Zero
 

 
m
s
(7)
where
 
m
 
is
 
the
 
mean
 
parameter
 
estimate
 
and
 
s
 
is
 
the
 
standard
deviation
 
of
 
the
 
estimate.
The
 
mean
 
parameter
 
estimate
 
in
 
Eq.
 
(7)
 
represents
 
the
estimated
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
random
 
parameter
 
in
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
model.
 
The
 
standard
 
deviation
 
denotes
 
the
 
deviation
 
from
 
the
mean
 
(assuming
 
that
 
the
 
parameter
 
follows
 
a
 
normal
 
distribution
as
 
applied
 
in
 
this
 
study).
 
A
 
standard
 
normal
 
distribution
 
curve
 
is
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
1.
 
After
 
calculating
 
the
 
Z-value,
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
the
 
distribution
 
being
 
less
 
than
 
zero
 
can
 
be
 
determined
 
from
the
 
Z-tables. Since
 one
 
of
 
the
 
objectives
 
is
 
to
 
compare
 
the
 
impact
 
of
common
 
variables
 
in
 
the
 
signalized
 
and
 
unsignalized
 
intersec
tions
 
models
 
on
 
the
 
severe
 
injury
 
probability,
 
elasticities
 
(or
marginal
 
effects)
 
are
 
used.
 
The
 
elasticities
 
depict
 
the
 
effect
 
of
change
 
in
 
an
 
independent
 
variable
 
on
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
severe
injuries.
 
The
 
elasticities
 
are
 
the
 
partial
 
derivatives
 
of
 
the
probability
 
of
 
crash
 
injury
 
severity
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
the
 
vector
of
 
independent
 
variables
 
(Zhang,
 
2010).
 
For
 
continuous
 
variables,
the
 
elasticity
 
measures
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
a
 
unit
 
change
 
in
 
an
independent
 
variable
 
on
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
speciﬁc
 
injury
 
(e.g.,
severe
 
injuries).
 
For
 
categorical
 
or
 
dummy
 
variables,
 
the
 
elasticity
represents
 
the
 
percentage
 
the
 
variable
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
severe
injuries. Note
 
that
 
a
 
major
 
issue
 
while
 
ﬁtting
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model
 
is
 
to
determine
 
random
 
parameters,
 
as
 
described
 
by
 
Moore
 
et
 
al.
(2011)
 
and
 
Haleem
 
and
 
Gan
 
(2013).
 
With
 
relatively
 
large
 
number
of
 
observations
 
and
 
independent
 
variables,
 
the
 
selection
 
of
random
 
variables
 
is
 
not
 
an
 
easy
 
task.
 
A
 
good
 
way
 
to
 
help
 
select
 
the
random
 
variables
 
is
 
to
 
rank
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
independent
 
variables
 
to
efﬁciently
 
determine
 
the
 
random
 
parameters.
 
The
 
random
 
forest
technique
 
was
 
therefore
 
adopted
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
to
 
screen
 
the
severity
 
predictors
 
before
 
ﬁtting
 
the
 
mixed
 
logit
 
model.
 
It
 
is
 
a
recent
 
machine
 
learning
 
technique
 
proposed
 
by
 
Breiman
 
(2001).
In
 
this
 
technique,
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
decision
 
trees
 
are
 
grown
 
(without
pruning)
 
by
 
randomly
 
selecting
 
some
 
observations
 
from
the
 
original
 
dataset
 
with
 
replacement,
 
then
 
searching
 
over
 
a
randomly
 
selected
 
subset
 
of
 
variables
 
at
 
each
 
split
 
(Grimm
 
et
 
al.,
2008).
 
Note
 
that
 
only
 
one
 
prediction
 
is
 
generated
 
from
 
the
ensemble
 
of
 
trees.
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
classiﬁcation
 
trees
(for
 
categorical
 
response
 
as
 
in
 
this
 
study),
 
the
 
prediction
 
is
determined
 
by
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
correct
 
classiﬁcations.
 
As
 
indicated
by
 
Grimm
 
et
 
al.
 
(2008),
 
random
 
forest
 
can
 
handle
 
noise
 
in
the
 
covariates,
 
yield
 
high
 
classiﬁcation
 
accuracy,
 
and
 
resist
overﬁtting.

Data
 
processing
 
and
 
explored
 
variables
Three
 
years
 
of
 
crash
 
data
 
from
 
2008
 
to
 
2010
 
were
 
used
 
to
identify
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
on
 
state
 
roads
 
in
 
Florida.
 
In
 
total,
7630
 
pedestrian
 
crashes
 
were
 
identiﬁed
 
from
 
the
 
Florida
 
Depart
ment
 
of
 
Transportation
 
(FDOT)
 
Crash
 
Analysis
 
Reporting
 
(CAR)
system.
 
Police
 
reports
 
of
 
these
 
7630
 
crashes
 
were
 
downloaded
 
and
were
 
reviewed
 
in
 
detail
 
to:
 
(1)
 
obtain
 
information
 
from
 
police
sketches
 
and
 
illustrations
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
each
 
pedestrian
 
crash
 
occurred;
 
(2)
 
verify
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
coded
 
crash
 
data
 
including
 
the
 
crash
 
type
 
and
 
crash

(3)
 
accurately
 
determine
 
the
 
crash
 
location;
 
and
 
(4)
collect
 
information
 
that
 
is
 
unavailable
 
in
 
the
 
crash
 
records,
 
such
 
as
pedestrian
 
age,
 
at-fault
 
road
 
user,
 
and
 
pedestrian
 
maneuver.
 
For
example,
 
in
 
Florida’s
 
CAR
 
system,
 
the
 
age
 
is
 
generally
 
recorded
 
for
the
 
at-fault
 
road
 
user
 
(can
 
be
 
either
 
a
 
driver
 
or
 
a
 
pedestrian).
 
Since
this
 
study
 
investigates
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
age
 
of
 
pedestrians
 
on
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity,
 
the
 
birth
 
year
 
of
 
the
 
pedestrian
 
involved
in
 
the
 
crash
 
was
 
recorded
 
from
 
the
 
police
 
reports
 
to
 
calculate
 
the
pedestrian
 
age. Examples
 of
 
the
 
information
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
available
 
in
 
Florida’s
crash
 
records
 
and
 
was
 
collected
 
from
 
the
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
police
reports
 
include:
 birth
 
year
 
of
 
pedestrian,
 injury
 
severity
 
of
 
pedestrian,
 at-fault
 
road
 
user,
 crash
 
location
 
(i.e.,
 
at
 
signalized
 
or
 
unsignalized
 
intersection),
 presence
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
signals,
 presence
 
of
 
pedestrian
 
refuge
 
area,
 crosswalk
 
type
 
(as
 
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
2),
 
and
 pedestrian
 
maneuver
 
(i.e.,
 
walking
 
along
 
the
 
roadway
 
or
 
crossing
the
 
street).
To
 
accurately
 
determine
 
the
 
crash
 
locations,
 
it
 
was
 
vital
 
to
review
 
the
 
illustrative
 
sketches
 
and
 
descriptions
 
in
 
the
 
police
reports.
 
Note
 
that
 
the
 
geographic
 
location
 
of
 
crashes
 
was
 
broadly
categorized
 
into
 
signalized
 
and
 
unsignalized
 
intersections.
 
The
 
ﬁve
levels
 
of
 
injury
 
severity
 
(fatal,
 
incapacitating
 
injury,
 
non-incapaci
tating
 
injury,
 
possible
 
injury,
 
and
 
PDO)
 
were
 
collected
 
from
 
the
police
 
reports.
 
PDO,
 
possible
 
injury,
 
and
 
non-incapacitating
 
injury
were
 
then
 
categorized
 
as
 
non-severe
 
injuries,
 
while
 
incapacitating
and
 
fatal
 
injuries
 
were
 
categorized
 
as
 
severe
 
injuries.
 
To
 
facilitate
and
 
speed-up
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
reviewing
 
police
 
reports,
 
an
 
in-house
web-based
 
tool
 
was
 
customized,
 
as
 
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
3.
Since
 
many
 
exploratory
 
variables
 
were
 
considered
 
in
 
this
 
study,
about
 
35%
 
of
 
crashes
 
had
 
a
 
missing
 
value
 
for
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
these
variables.
 
Although
 
each
 
police
 
report
 
was
 
reviewed
 
in
 
detail,
some
 
information
 
was
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
collect,
 
possibly
 
due
 
to
 
missing
data
 
and
 
insufﬁcient
 
information
 
in
 
the
 
police
 
reports.
 
For
example,
 
some
 
pedestrian
 
birth
 
year
 
and
 
pedestrian
 
injury
 
severity
records
 
were
 
empty
 
in
 
the
 
police
 
reports,
 
some
 
police
 
reports
 
did
