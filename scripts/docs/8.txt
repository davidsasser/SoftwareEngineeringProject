Abstract Socioeconomic factors are known to be con-
tributing factors for vehicle-pedestrian crashes. Al-
though several studies have examined the socioeconom-
ic factors related to the location of the crashes, limited
studies have considered the socioeconomic factors of
the neighborhood where the road users live in vehicle-
pedestrian crash modelling. This research aims to iden-
tify the socioeconomic factors related to both the neigh-
borhoods where the road users live and where crashes
occur that have an influence on vehicle-pedestrian crash
severity. Data on vehicle-pedestrian crashes that oc-
curred at mid-blocks in Melbourne, Australia, was ana-
lyzed. Neighborhood factors associated with road users’
residents and location of crash were investigated using
boosted regression tree (BRT). Furthermore, partial de-
pendence plots were applied to illustrate the interactions
between these factors. We found that socioeconomic
factors accounted for 60% of the 20 top contributing
factors to vehicle-pedestrian crashes. This research re-
veals that socioeconomic factors of the neighborhoods
where the road users live and where the crashes occur
are important in determining the severity of the crashes,

with the former having a greater influence. Hence, road
safety countermeasures, especially those focussing on
the road users, should be targeted at these high-risk
neighborhoods.

Introduction

Pedestrians are known as vulnerable road users due to
their lack of protection and are thus more likely to be
killed or seriously harmed in vehicle-pedestrian crashes.
For example, pedestrians are 23 times more likely to be
killed in vehicle-pedestrian crashes than car occupants
in the USA [1]. According to the World Health Organi-
sation [2], 22% of the 1.25 million people killed each
year in road traffic crashes worldwide are pedestrians. In
Calgary, Canada, only 7.4% of the vehicle-vehicle col-
lisions on local roads resulted in injuries [3], but 84.8%
of the pedestrian-vehicle collisions on local roads result-
ed in deaths or serious injuries [4]. In Great Britain, 23%
of all fatalities in road crashes in 2013 were pedestrians
[5] and 39% of the traffic fatalities in Korea were
pedestrians [6]. Likewise, 4884 pedestrians were killed
in the USA and an estimated 65,000 were injured in
traffic crashes in 2014 [7].

Therefore, vehicle-pedestrian crashes are a major
concern in many countries, and many studies have been

conducted to identify the factors contributing to these
crashes. Personal characteristics of pedestrian, such as
age and gender, have been found to be significant var-
iables in several studies [6, 8–10], while vehicle type
and road geometry factors have been identified as im-
portant variables in other studies [11–13]. Additionally,
the influences of built environment, environment con-
dition, and speed limit have also been investigated in
many studies [14–17].

Relatively few studies, however, had examined the
contribution of socioeconomic factors, such as culture,
income and level of education, on vehicle-pedestrian
crashes. Campos-Outcalt et al. [18] examined the influ-
ence of race and ethnicity on pedestrian crashes in
Arizona and revealed that the rates and circumstances
of pedestrian deaths were affected by these factors. In
addition, several studies had examined the influences of
income and education level on vehicle-pedestrian
crashes [19–22].

In general, two main approaches were used to exam-
ine the influence of socioeconomic variables on vehicle-
pedestrian crashes. Some studies used the socioeconom-
ic characteristics of the neighborhood where pedestrians
lived [19, 21, 22] while other studies used the socioeco-
nomic factors related to the neighborhoods where the
crash occurred [23, 24]. However, limited or no study
has investigated the socioeconomic factors related to
both types of neighborhoods or examined their relative
importance.

Studies show that social and economic factors related
to location of crashes could influence on vehicle-
pedestrian severity level (Table 1). For instance, Wier
et al. [25] and Graham et al. [26] showed that the
proportion of low-income households and the propor-
tion of people without access to a motor vehicle were
contributing factors for vehicle-pedestrian crash injury
severity. Therefore, understanding the social and eco-
nomic factors related to location of crashes may assist
road safety professionals to target suburbs to apply site-
specific pedestrian safety programs and improving
vehicle-pedestrian safety issue in these suburbs.

Meanwhile, other studies showed that socio-
economic factors could influence road users’ behavior
[27, 28]. For instance, studies showed that ethnicity and
family background were important factors associated
with traffic crashes [29–31]. Therefore, using drivers’
and pedestrians’ residency neighborhood social and
economic factors can assist in identifying target suburbs
to apply different road user behavior change programs

and improve traffic safety knowledge of road users in
these suburbs.

This research aims to examine the influence of so-
cioeconomic factors of the neighborhoods where the
crashes occur, the neighborhoods where drivers live
and the neighborhoods where pedestrians live, as well
as examining their relative importance. It will examine
the neighborhoods where the road users live (residency
neighborhood) and where the crashes occur (crash
neighborhood) on vehicle-pedestrian crash severity,
while controlling for the influences of roadway, road
user, vehicle and environmental factors. It will contrib-
ute to advancing knowledge in the field as very limited
research has been conducted to examine the influence of
socioeconomic factors of both the neighborhoods where
the crashes occur and where the pedestrians live.

Data

Data on vehicle-pedestrian crashes on public roads that
occurred at mid-blocks in the Melbourne metropolitan
area from 2004 to 2013 were extracted from Victoria
Road Crash Information database. Melbourne metropol-
itan area refers to Capital City Statistical Division (Cap-
ital City SDs) in Australian Standard Geographical Clas-
sification (ASGC) [32]. According to ASGC definition,
Capital City SDs are predominantly urban in character
and represent the state/territory capital cities in the wider
sense. Figure 1 shows the Melbourne metropolitan area.
It should be noted that in Victoria, Australia, only crashes
resulting in deaths or injuries were required to be report-
ed to the police. In this database, the severity of a crash
was determined by the person who suffered the most
severe injury and was recorded using three categories. A
fatal crash referred to a crash in which at least one person
died within 30 days of a collision. According to
VicRoads classification, a serious injury crash referred
to a collision that resulted in at least one person being
sent to hospital. Other injury crash referred to a crash that
did not have any fatality or serious injury.

Data on the socioeconomic factors were extracted
from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Since infor-
mation on the postcodes of the crash location and the
addresses of the persons involved in the crash (residency
location) were available in the crash database, socioeco-
nomic data at the postcode level were extracted from the
ABS. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was then
used to merge the crash information and the

socioeconomic data. The final dataset used contained
3577 crashes, of which 152 (4%) were fatal crashes,
1679 (47%) were serious injury crashes and 1746
(49%) were other injury crashes. It should be noted that
20% of pedestrian, 11% of drivers and only 6% of both
drivers and pedestrians had the same postcode for the
crash location and residency locations. Table 1 and 2
show the summary of categorical and continuous vari-
ables used in this research.

Method

GIS is applied in this research to compile the dataset. All
data including crash data, social and economic data and
traffic data are added as separate layers in Arcmap GIS
and merges using the postcodes of the crash locations
and the postcodes of the road users’ addresses to their.
The final dataset includes traffic and road characteristics
data, personal characteristics data and socioeconomic
data for location of crashes and road users’ residency
neighborhood. Then, this final dataset is applied in
boosted decision tree (BDT) to identify contributing
factors for vehicle-pedestrian crashes. Figure 2 shows
the method that is applied in this research.

Non-parametric techniques such as decision tree
(DT) and support vector machine have been used in
different traffic crash severity analysis [33–38]. The
DT approach is a simple and powerful method to solve
classification problems and provides a graphical struc-
ture using a tree with many branches and leaves. These
graphical features are useful in understanding and
interpreting the results [34].

In DT models, the root node in top of tree which
contains all objects is split into two homogeneous sets that
are called child nodes. Then, DT splits child nodes until no
further split can be made, i.e. all child nodes are homog-
enous (or a user-defined minimum number of objects in
the node is reached). These final nodes are called terminal
nodes or leaves and they have no branches. DT then
removes all branches with little impact on the predictive
value of the tree. In the DT technique, the best tree is
determined by dividing the sample into learning and test
sub-samples and the testing error rates or costs are used to
prune the tree. The learning sample is used to grow an
overly large tree. Then, the test sample is used to estimate
the rate at which cases are misclassified (possibly adjusted
by misclassification costs). The misclassification error rate
is calculated for the largest tree and also for every sub-tree.
The best sub-tree is the one with the lowest or near-lowest
cost, which may be a relatively small tree.

Fig. 2 Methodology that is applied in this research

One disadvantage of the DT model is that it is often
unstable, and the results may change significantly with
changes in the training and testing the data [39]. There-
fore, ensemble models, such as bagged decision tree
(BgDT), boosted decision tree (BDT) and random forest
(RF), are applied in some studies to improve the reli-
ability and accuracy of DT models [24, 40–44]. Since
BDT has better performance in vehicle-pedestrian crash
severity analysis than DT and BgDT models [24], BDT
model is applied in this research to explore the factors
contributing to vehicle-pedestrian crash severity.

BDT combines regression trees and boosting technique
to improve the performance of DT models. Boosting is a
forward and stage-wise procedure in which a subset of data
is randomly selected to iteratively produce new tree models
to improve the quality of prediction [45]. This process
introduces a stochastic gradient boosting procedure that
can improve model performance and reduce the risk of
over-fitting [46]. In stochastic gradient boosting procedure,
at each iteration, a subsample of the training data is drawn
at random (without replacement) from the full training
dataset. The randomly selected subsample is then used,
instead of the full sample, to fit the base learner.

In this approach, after the first tree is fitted, the
residuals are calculated. In BDT, the difference between
the target function and the current predictions of an
ensemble is called the residual. In next step, observa-
tions with high residual values are defined as an obser-
vation with high prediction error. Then, BDT calculates
the adjustment weights using Eq. 1:
